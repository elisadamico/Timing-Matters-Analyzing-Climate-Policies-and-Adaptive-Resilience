## Abstract
In the realm of climate policy, policymakers and scholars have traditionally focused on the overarching question of whether policies work. In this paper, we shift the focus to a more nuanced inquiry: when do these policies work? Leveraging available data on adaptation laws and adaptive capacity, we utilize a comprehensive change point analysis and segmented regression methodology to explore the temporal dynamics of climate policies and uncover patterns indicating the critical junctures at which these policies lead to their intended outcomes. We find that adaptation laws had a more positive impact on adaptive readiness between 1999 and 2006, while they negatively correlate with climate readiness in post-2016 years. This analysis highlights the importance of exogenous factors, the rule of law, and regional variations in studying climate policy effectiveness. By emphasizing the temporal alignment between policy implementation and climate outcomes, this research underscores the importance of proactive efforts in combating climate change.
